# Data-Science-Capstone

## Introduction 

In this project, I will try to find an optimal location to rent an apartment in Toronto. I will try to apply the data science techniques to discover the utmost neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the following criterias:

* Number of groccery stores.
* Number of parks	
* Number of coffee shops	
* Number of resturants	
* Number of transit stops	
* Crime rates	
* Average price of rentals

This project mostly targets the newcomers to the city of Toronto, who are not familiar with the neighborhoods of Toronto.

## Data

I decided to use the following data sources for the defined criterias:

* `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M`: which corresponds to the neighborhoods of Toronto

* `http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data`: This data source contains the coordinates of each postal code. Therefore, its corresponding neighborhoods.
* **Foursquare API**: to explore each neighborhood.
* `https://www.kaggle.com/brahmdata/major-crime-indicators201419-toronto-police`: The location of any crime that happened in Toronto from 2014 till 2019.
* `https://www.kaggle.com/rajacsp/toronto-apartment-price`: The address and the rent of each available apartment in Toronto.
