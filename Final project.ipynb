As one of the immigrants, I would compare different neighborhoods in Montreal, Quebec based on different parameters. Here is the list of parameters that are considered to suggest the best neighborhoods in Montreal:\n\n1. Transit Access\n2. Crime Rate\n3. Park Access\n4. Restaurants and bar Access\n\n\nHopefully, this study helps immigrants to find the most convenient neighborhood for them to live in Montreal."

            "source": "<H2>DATA</H2>\n\n\nIn this problem, I will use the Foursquare dataset to find restaurants, bars, and parks in each neighborhood in Montreal.\n\nI would also use the publicly available dataset on Montreal Transit Scheduling Data from here: https://data.Montreal.ca/Transportation-Transit/Montreal-Transit-Scheduling-Data/npk7-z3bj\n\nThis dataset contains five files, including trips.txt, shapes.txt, stop_times.txt, stops.txt, calendar.txt, routes.txt, calendar_dates.txt and agency.txt. In this project, probably I will use stops.txt as the main file to explore.\n\nAlso, I will use Community Crime and Disorder Statistics data which is also publicly available here: https://data.Montreal.ca/Health-and-Safety/Community-Crime-and-Disorder-Statistics/848s-4m4z\n\nThis dataset contains Sector, Community Name, Group Category, Category, Crime Count, Resident Count, Date, Year, Month ID, Community and Center Point. I will also use most of these columns to gather information about the rates in different neighborhoods."
